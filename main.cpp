Project 5: Part 1 / 4
 video Chapter 2 - Part 12

 Create a branch named Part1

Purpose:  This project continues developing Project3 and will take you through how to write code that doesn't leak as well as how to refactor. 

 Destructors

 If you didn't do Project3, write 3 UDTs below (where it asks for Copied UDTs) that have: 
        member functions,
        member variables, 
        constructors that initialize the members. 
        for() or while() loops that modify member variables
        
 Define your implementations of all functions OUTSIDE of the class. 
 Then do instruction 2)
 
 If you DID do Project 3, do instruction 1)
 
 1) Copy a few of your user-defined types (the ones with constructors and for()/while() loops from Project 3) here
 2) add destructors
        make the destructors do something like print out the name of the class.

	If you already did Chapter2 part 10 on Coliru and don't have a Project3, just grab some UDTs from your Coliru Ch2P10 submission. 
 
 3) add 2 new UDTs that use only the types you copied above.
 4) Add destructors to these 2 new types that do stuff.  
        maybe print out the name of the class being destructed, or call a member function of one of the members.  be creative
 
 5) copy over your main() from the end of Project3 and get it to compile with the types you copied over.
        remove any code in main() that uses types you didn't copy over.
 
 6) Instantiate your 2 UDT's from step 4) in the main() function at the bottom.
 
 7) After you finish, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
 
 Commit your changes by clicking on the Source Control panel on the left, entering a message, and click [Commit and push].
